Video Trends by Country Dashboard using Tableau

### Project Description
This project analyzes global YouTube trending videos by examining patterns across various categories and regions through interactive visualizations by applying filters that affect multiple charts and correlate both by date and region.

The study centered on:
-Determining which categories appear most often in the trending list
-Exploring how trends vary geographically
-Comparing the behavior of the United States with other regions

### 🔎Key Findings
