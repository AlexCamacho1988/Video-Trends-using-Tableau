Video Trends by Country Dashboard using Tableau

Project Description: Publish a dashboard online with information on trending YouTube videos by region and date using Tableau.

Tools: Tableau, pie charts, tables.

Challenge: Identify the charts that best showcase trending videos, as well as their percentages by region and date. Apply filters that affect multiple charts and correlate both by date and region.

Results: an online dashboard was published with two filters (date and region) showing trends and their percentages by video genre, and a pie chart displaying the percentages of trending videos by region. An independent table was added to show the total number of videos by genre and region.
